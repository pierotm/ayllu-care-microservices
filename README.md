# ayllu-care-microservices
This repository contains the microservices-based backend for a AylluCare application. Designed following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and built around clearly defined bounded contexts, the system embraces a decentralized architecture to enhance scalability, maintainability, and independent deployment of services. Each microservice encapsulates a specific business domain, ensuring a clean separation of concerns and facilitating agile development and integration.
